Implement a sample machine learning program for a problem statement of your choice.

## Project : House Price Prediction using Machine Learning with Python


## Introduction
- Estimating the sale prices of houses is one of the basic projects to have on your Data Science CV. By finishing this article, you will be able to predict continuous variables using various types of linear regression algorithm.

Why linear regression? Linear regression is an algorithm used to predict values that are continuous in nature. It became more popular because it is the best algorithm to start with if you are a newbie to ML.



## Understanding the correlation between various features in the dataset

 - Positive Correlation
- Negative Correlation
